# User_Engagement_on_Instagram
Utilize the most recent 500 posts from Instagram’s common news media such as Washington Post, CNN and NY Times to understand what kind of imagery drive engagement (likes)

## Problem Statement:
Utilize the most recent 500 posts from Instagram’s common news media such as Washington Post, CNN and NY Times to understand what kind of imagery drive engagement (likes).

## Why does this Matter: 
While the kind of news being covered is going to be a common denominator across channels, the scope for differentiation is through the content that sets the tone for news items – (i.e.) images and captions. While Washington Post is more graphic/artsy in its approach, CNN and NY Times rely on real life photos. Hence, it would be good to understand what each of their audiences are drawn to & focus on those in the future to drive up engagement.

## Data Source:
Around 500 posts of each news media were pulled from Instagram Washington, NY and CNN


## Process:
1. Instagram Scraping
2. Image Anlaytics
3. Topic Modeling


## Observations:
CNN:                                          
Topics’ % proportion:
Human features     : 37.80%
Nature                    : 12.84%
Background            : 49.35%

NY Times:
Topics’ % proportion:
Food	                 : 17.09%
Entertainment        : 18.24%
Event                     : 19.07%
People                   : 31.02%

Washington Post:
Topics’ % proportion:
Event	                  : 67.55%
Background            : 16.76%
Geometry/ graphic : 15.68%

## Recommendations:
The most commonly liked posts are related to human features in CNN posts, people-related in NY Times posts, while event-related in Washington Post posts. Hence, for increasing engagement, this analysis can be helpful.
All the channels have commonality with topics related to people even though each channel has different characteristics for viewership.

### Possible Strategies
1. Focus on topics that have high engagement 
2. Focus on topics that have low engagement for your channel but work well for the competition. This can allow us to identify differences in strategy and implement new techniques to increase engagement. 
3. Make A/B test which compares current images to other real images on same topic. For example, Washington Post does graphics so the new images introduced can be real images. Is there better engagement with new images?
